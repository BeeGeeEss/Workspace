                <p>Band member since 2020</p>
                <p>AJ Walker was discovered in 2003 by manager Richard Wallis, who signed the 14-year-old to a two-year deal. At the time she was writing pop songs and playing drums in a grunge band part time. The label wanted to make her a solo pop artist, but AJ objected to this, saying that she wanted to be part of a band and play grunge music. Thia all changed when she met Joey and Blax and moved into the metal scene.</p>
