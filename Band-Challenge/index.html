              <p>The band Zed Leppelin, unsurprisingly took its name from the famous band Led Zeppelin - in what started out as a piss take - but ended up as a very successful band in its own right. The band crashed its way onto the metal scene in 2008 with their debut album <em>'Sell Satan'</em>.
                <br></br>The band experienced a lull in their career when they changed band members and struggled to find their place in the scene. But post-covid, people came back to music in a <strong>BIG WAY</strong> and Zed Leppelin sky-rocketed in the charts with their latest album <em>'Mouse Trap'</em>.
                <br></br>Original band members Joey and Blaxall met in the early 2000's at a house party and knew they wanted to shred together - the band welcomed two more members AJ and Rio in 2020 after they saw them play in a part-time grunge band.</p>

              <h3>What would metal be without controversy?</h3>

              <p>In the early days of the band - members went a bit hard at their first live sold out venue.
                <br></br>It was all too much for poor Joey who fell over <em>and</em> threw up...
                <br></br>He woke up in the morning a viral sensation, after concert goers had posted footage.

              <p>Who amongst us hasn't gotten a little bit worked up at a metal concert?
                <br></br>In 2022 a fan stormed the stage and attempted to wrestle the microphone from Blaxalls hands...
                <br></br>Brave!
                <br></br>Blaxall let the fan sing a chorus, and then he was promptly dragged out by about <em>10</em> security guards!! (ok, it was three).
