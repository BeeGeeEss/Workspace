### Purpose of Website
The purpose of the website is to design a website that showcases my talent, abilities and coding experience.
The website must include information about who I am, hobbies and interests, work-relevant skills, previous employment, projects and contact details.

### Purpose of Wireframes
The purpose of the wireframes is to plan the websites design & layout before beginning programming.

### Main goals of Wireframes
I focused particularly on responsive design, creating white space, and ease of usability. Though the wireframes are presented from extra large devices to extra small devices, the website will be programmed from a mobile-first approach.

### Notable Changes
The wireframes highlight key areas of the website that need to be considered for multiple device screen sizes. These include:
- Header
- Navigation Bar
- Sections in the Main Body
- Drop-down Fields
- Prioritisation of Information
- White Space
